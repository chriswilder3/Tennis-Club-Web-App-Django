    Relative vs Absolute URLs

    Relative URLs: These are URLs relative to the current page. 
    For example, members/ (without the leading /) will be interpreted by
     the browser relative to the current page's path.
    If you're on /members/details/1, the browser will interpret 
    members/ as /members/details/members/ â€” which is incorrect and 
    will likely result in a 404 error (page not found).
    
    Absolute URLs: These are URLs that start from the root of your
     website. An absolute URL starts with /. 
     So, /members/ will be interpreted as http://yourdomain.com/members/, 
     which is the correct path to your "Members" page.
